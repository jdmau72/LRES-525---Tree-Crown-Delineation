# Tree Crown Delineation with DeepForest Python Package
My semester project for LRES 525 - Remote Sensing. Project utilizes deep learning models to identify individual trees using satellite imagery data. 

## Description
For this research, I look to test the effectiveness of deep learning models to identify individual trees using satellite imagery data. My hypothesis is that a general model can be used to effectively identify most individuals; however, I do not believe that satellite imagery data will be good enough to accurately identify species. To test this hypothesis, I used remote sensing NEON data to attempt to identify tree crowns. The satellite imagery and tree data come from the University of Notre Dame Environmental Research Center, in the southwest Ottawa National Forest, located between northern Wisconsin and Michiganâ€™s Upper Peninsula. The dominant species in this location include red and sugar maple, aspen, paper birch, balsam fir, and hemlock.
